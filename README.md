- **Smooth Interactions**:

  - Smooth transitions for links and icons.
- **Hamburger Menu**: Collapsible menu for smaller screens with clean animations.
- **Gradient Background**: Eye-catching gradient design for the navbar.
- **Font Awesome Icons**: Enhances visual appeal by incorporating icons for menu items.
- **Minimal Code**: Clean, modular structure for easy customization.

## Technologies Used

- Links are styled with a gradient background and modern fonts.

### Mobile:
- A hamburger menu icon replaces the horizontal menu.
- Clicking the icon toggles a dropdown menu with slide-in animations.

### Sticky Navbar:
- The navbar sticks to the top of the page, providing easy access to navigation links while scrolling.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance accessibility for screen readers.
- Allow users to toggle between light and dark themes.
